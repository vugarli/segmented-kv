# Key-value storage engine written in Go
Inspired by [Bitcask](https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf)

Developed with the intention of learning Go fundamentals and creating a platform to build upon in the future, as I want to implement different kinds of optimizations later.

I also plan to develop a server-side component for it.
